# Hydrologic-Model-to-Predict-Streamflow-for-Delaware-River
This is a model developed while taking Dr. Chuck Kroll's ERE 645 Hydrologic Modeling course during the Spring of 2016.

The goal of the model is to predict streamflow for the Delaware River in Hale Eddy, NY using a simple precipitation-runoff modeling approach.

All this work was done independently based on instructor assignment and received an A.
